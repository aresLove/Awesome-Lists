# OpenSource

* [2018-Botpress #Project#](https://github.com/botpress/botpress): Botpress is an open-source bot creation tool written in Javascript. It is powered by a rich set of open-source modules built by the community. We like to say that Botpress is like the Wordpress of Chatbots; anyone can create and reuse other people's modules.
