# DataScienceAI Models List

本文包含了一些基于人工智能、机器学习、深度学习等技术，实现的有趣的模型、应用、案例。

# Machine Learning

- [SPTAG #Project#](https://github.com/microsoft/SPTAG): A distributed approximate nearest neighborhood search (ANN) library which provides a high quality vector index build, search and distributed online serving toolkits for large scale vector search scenario.

# DeepLearning

# Natural Language Processing

- [2018-BERT #Project#](https://github.com/google-research/bert): BERT is method of pre-training language representations, meaning that we train a general-purpose "language understanding" model on a large text corpus (like Wikipedia), and then use that model for downstream NLP tasks that we care about (like question answering).

## ASR & TTL

- [ASRT_SpeechRecognition #Project#](https://github.com/nl8590687/ASRT_SpeechRecognition): A Deep-Learning-Based Chinese Speech Recognition System.

## RNN

- [char-rnn #Project#](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn): Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU, RNN) for character-level language models in Torch

## Linguistic Structure

# Game | 游戏
