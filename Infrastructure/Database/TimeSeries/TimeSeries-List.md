# TimeSeries Database List

- [2017-Writing a Time Series Database from Scratch](https://fabxc.org/blog/2017-04-10-writing-a-tsdb/): While the current storage has served us well, I propose a newly designed storage subsystem that corrects for shortcomings of the existing solution and is equipped to handle the next order of scale.

* [2017-Design of a Cost Efficient Time Series Store for Big Data](https://medium.com/@leventov/design-of-a-cost-efficient-time-series-store-for-big-data-88c5dc41af8e): This post is based on experience of running Druid at scale at Metamarkets and theoretical research, but the described design has not yet implemented and tested in production.

- [2018-TimescaleDB vs. InfluxDB: purpose built differently for time-series data](https://parg.co/o2K): An in-depth look into how two leading time-series databases stack up in terms of data model, query language, reliability, performance, ecosystem, operational management, and company/community support.
