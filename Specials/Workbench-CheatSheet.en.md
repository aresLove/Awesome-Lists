# Workbench CheatSheet: macOS Development Environment of 2018

In this blog post, which is motivated by [My Linux Development Environment of 2018](https://dev.to/brpaz/my-linux-development-environment-of-2018-ch7), I will talk a bit about the setup and software of my personal laptop, powered by macOS.

Auto import

Automatically finds, parses and provides code actions and code completion for all available imports. Works with Typescript and TSX.

Beautify

Automatically formats your JavaScript, HTML and CSS code. (Yeah, like magic!).

Clipboard History

Keeps a history of your copied and cut items and let's you re-paste them if needed.

Git History

View git log along with the graph and details. You can view the history of a file or a specific line.

Code Runner

Let's you run a file or a selected part of your code to quickly check the output. I normally use it when working with JavaScript, but it supports quite a wide range of other languages as well.

Docker

Do I really need to explain this one? If you don't know what Docker is by now, go ahead and google it. You can thank me later ðŸ˜‰.

(Jk. You can go here, here and here for more Docker goodness).

Material Icon Theme

What? Don't you like cute little icons on your explorer? Ok, then. Skip this one if you want.

Path Intellisense

I mean... the name says it all, doesn't it?

CSS classes intellisense

Aids you by giving you hints of possible CSS class names that are already in your project so you don't have to constanlty switch tabs over and over.

NodeJS Modules Intellisense

Autocompletes the names of the core NodeJS modules and the ones you specified in your package.json available for you. Quite useful when starting to learn about Node.

ExpressSnippet

If you are learning/using NodeJS, chances are that you are also going to be using ExpressJS, so this extesion provides a few code snippets so you can focus on your logic rather than the boilerplate around your get(), post(), put(), delete() methods.

Markdownlint

This extension is similar to jshint. It warns you of possible mistakes in your Markdown code that is commonly used in open source projects across GitHub and other version control hosting platforms in a way, whether it's a RAEDME.md or CONTRIBUTING.md, they all use Markdown.

Polacode

Allows you to copy and paste blocks of code that you want and transform them into a screenshot with a good looking standard template. (Similar to how window-based screenshots look in MacOS).
